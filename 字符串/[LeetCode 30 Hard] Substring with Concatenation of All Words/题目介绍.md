[查找拼接子串]](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

给定字符串s，以及一个长度相同的word的list——words，查找s中符合words拼接的子串的起始位置

**P.S.起始位置可以是任何位置，而非word长度的倍数**

Example 1:
```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```
