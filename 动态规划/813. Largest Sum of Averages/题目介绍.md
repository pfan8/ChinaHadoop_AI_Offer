[分成K组的最大值](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/)

给定一个数组和一个整数K，`K < 数组size`，将数组分为K组，每组求平均值，再将所有平均值加总。

问能获得的最大总和

```
Example:
Input: 
A = [9,1,2,3,9]
K = 3
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.
```

Note:
+ 1 <= A.length <= 100.
+ 1 <= A[i] <= 10000.
+ 1 <= K <= A.length.
