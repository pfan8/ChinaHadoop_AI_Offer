[最近公共祖先LCA](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

给定root，p，q，返回p和q的LCA，如果不存在则返回NULL

例如，给定二叉树`root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
